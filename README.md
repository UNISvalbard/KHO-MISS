# Software for Meridian Imaging Svalbard Spectrograph (MISS)

The [University Centre in Svalbard](https://www.unis.no) operates an optical observatory, [Kjell Henriksen Observatory](http://kho.unis.no), for space research in Svalbard, Norway. This repository collects various routines and software for the Meridian Imaging Svalbard Spectrograph (MISS).

MISS uses custom optics to record visible spectra along the (magnetic) meridian. Nominally, the instrument operates during the dark time of the day and continuously records images in [PGM-format](https://netpbm.sourceforge.net/). While the captured spectra covers the visible wavelengths (400-700nm), the realtime data found at the KHO website uses a quick-n-dirty RGB composite image. Similar keograms, time vs. latitude, plots are used for summary plots as well.
